## Cleansing Data with Python for Tableau Dashboard
My project involves transforming a csv dataset from the CDC on disability statistics into a clean, Tableau-ready format.

## Project Description
Utilizing Python, Iâ€™ve developed a script that streamlines the dataset by selecting key columns like year, location, and disability type, and removing unnecessary identifiers and incomplete records. The outcome is a polished dataset, optimized for creating powerful visualizations that reveal the trends and truths hidden within the numbers.

## Original Data
The original dataset was sourced from the CDC's "Prevalence of Disability Status and Types" report. As the dataset does not have a direct download link, it can be found through a Google search using the phrase "Source: DHDS - Prevalence of Disability Status and Types."

## Cleaning Process
1. Uncleansed Data: The raw, uncleaned data can be viewed [here](https://github.com/catliugit/cleaning_data_with_python/blob/main/input_data/DHDS_-_Prevalence_of_Disability_Status_and_Types_20240721.csv).
2. Python Code: The Python script used for cleaning the data is available in this repository as [Clean_Data.py](https://github.com/catliugit/cleaning_data_with_python/blob/main/src/clean_data.py)
3. Cleansed Data: The cleaned and processed data is accessible [cleansed data](https://github.com/catliugit/cleaning_data_with_python/blob/main/output_data/disability_data_clean.csv) 

## Tableau Visualization
I then uploaded this file into Tableau Desktop, where I created a visual representation of the data. You can view my published Tableau Dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/catliuvisuals/viz/DisabilitiesintheU_S_2016-2022/DisabilitiesintheU_S_2016-2022).
